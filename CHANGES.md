## Files Modified

### 1. `background.js`
- **Modified `translateText()` function**: Updated the API prompt to request structured JSON response including translation + 2 example sentences
- **Updated `callDeepSeekAPI()` and `callOpenAIAPI()`**: Modified to parse JSON responses and handle fallback for non-JSON responses
- **Changed system messages**: Updated to request JSON format responses

### 2. `content.js`
- **Enhanced popup structure**: Added new examples section to the popup UI
- **Updated `requestTranslation()` function**: Modified to handle both old string format and new object format with examples
- **Added example display logic**: Creates DOM elements for each example sentence with English and translated versions

### 3. `popup.css`
- **Added styles for examples section**: New CSS classes for `.examples-section`, `.examples-container`, `.example-item`
- **Enhanced visual design**: Used yellow/amber color scheme for examples to distinguish from translation
- **Improved responsive layout**: Increased popup width to 380px and max-height to 500px to accommodate examples
- **Added scrollable examples**: Max-height for examples container with scroll when needed

### 4. `test.html` (New File)
- Created test page with various words and phrases for testing the extension
- Includes setup instructions and expected behavior documentation

## API Response Format

The extension now uses proper structured outputs to ensure reliable JSON responses:

### OpenAI API (Structured Outputs)
For OpenAI, the extension uses the `response_format` parameter with a JSON schema to guarantee structured responses:
```javascript
response_format: {
  type: "json_schema",
  json_schema: {
    name: "translation_with_examples",
    schema: responseSchema,
    strict: true
  }
}
```

### DeepSeek API (Enhanced Prompting)  
For DeepSeek, which doesn't support structured outputs yet, enhanced prompting ensures JSON format compliance.

### Expected JSON Format
Both APIs return this structure:
```json
{
  "translation": "the translation here",
  "examples": [
    {
      "english": "example sentence 1",
      "translation": "translated example 1"
    },
    {
      "english": "example sentence 2", 
      "translation": "translated example 2"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains backward compatibility with the old string-only response format. If the API returns a simple string instead of JSON, it will display just the translation without examples.

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. Load the extension in Chrome
2. Configure API credentials (DeepSeek or OpenAI)
3. Open `test.html` in Chrome
4. Double-click on any test word or phrase
5. Verify the popup shows translation + 2 example sentences

## Next Steps

The extension is ready to use with the enhanced sample sentences feature. The AI APIs should now provide more contextual examples to help users better understand how to use translated words in real sentences.
